      <description>The problem being addressed: The previous TinyVMI project[1] was a minimal portion of LibVMI with capability of reading a target VM&amp;rsquo;s memory pages when a kernel virtual address was given. Now we need to extend TinyVMI with events support, and other capabilities of LibVMI, such as support for both 32 &amp;amp; 64 bit systems, both Windows &amp;amp; Linux OS, etc.. Additionally, during the development, documentations need to be carefully written and progresses will be reported in a public blog site.</description>
